## Platform
Android

### Unity Version 
5.5.4f1

### GVR Unity SDK Version
1.50.0

### Lighting Test & Notes
I tested baking the light at 40 & 80 resolution which made a ton of anti-aliasing, and it looked like one of the lights blew out. I then tried uncompressed at 40 which was even more anti-aliasing. I changed some of the lights and tested 5 uncompressed started looking better. 5 was a lot closer, but when I brought the resolution down to "2 compressed" that looked the best.
This project took me longer than I thought. The original issue was getting the correct versiono of Unity and the Gvr SDK to sync up. Once that was done it was about 1.5 days. The lighting was the most challenging part of this project.

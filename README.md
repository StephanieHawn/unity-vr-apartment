## Platform
Android

### Unity Version 
5.5.4f1

### GVR Unity SDK Version
1.50.0

### Lighting Test Notes
I tested baking the light at 40 & 80 resolution which made a ton of anti-aliasing, and it looked like one of the lights blew out. I then tried uncompressed at 40 which was even more anti-aliasing. I changed some of the lights and tested 5 uncompressed started looking better. 5 was a lot closer, but when I brought the resolution down to "2 compressed" that looked the best.
